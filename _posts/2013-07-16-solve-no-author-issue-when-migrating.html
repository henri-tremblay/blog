<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">These days, I'm migrating Subversion repositories to Git.<br /><br />I've followed this <a href="http://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/03/moving-from-svn-to-git/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> that hasn't failed my so far.<br /><br />However, today, this command<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">git svn clone https://svn.mysite.com/repo --authors-file=users.txt --no-metadata --stdlayout repo</span>failed because of a mysterious "(no author)".<br /><br />The explanation is that Subversion seems allow a check-in by no one. Classically, the first check-in on Google Code for instance.<br /><br />To solve it, just add<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">(no author) = Joe Smith &lt;joe.smith@gmail.com&gt;</span><br />at the end of your user file. The person should obviously be a meaningful one (like the guy who has created the project on Google Code).<br /><br /></div>
