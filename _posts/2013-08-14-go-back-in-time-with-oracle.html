<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today, I was needing to change the system date of a Linux server hosting and Oracle database.<br /><br />It seems that Oracle has some king of internal epoch. Restarting the database with a date to far in the past will end into and internal error.<br /><br />In my case, 2000 is the limit. Any date before that and Oracle won't start. Cute.&nbsp;</div>
