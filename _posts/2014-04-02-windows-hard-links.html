<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As on Unix, it is also possible on Windows to create a hard link to a file. I'm using this feature to backup in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;files that need to be placed in some other directory. For instance, my ssh <code>config</code> file.<br /><br />Here's how you do it from a <code>cmd:</code><br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint sh">mklink /h %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\.ssh\config %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config<br /></pre><br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Note that there is no way to visualy know that it is a hard link. You have to guess and confirm your intuition doing:<br /><br /></div><pre class="prettyprint sh">fsutil hardlink list config<br /></pre><br /><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Also, if you are wondering, delete one of the file doesn't delete the file. You need to delete all links to it to get rid of it. </div></div>
