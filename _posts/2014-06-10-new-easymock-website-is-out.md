After years having the most vintage open source website out there,
the EasyMock team is proud to announce that the [new website](http://easymock.org) is up and running.

Please tell us what you think. Directly on the pages using Disqus, in comment of this blog post, by
twitter (@henri_tremblay) or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/easymock/easymock)

Next steps:

* Deliver EasyMock 3.3 ASAP!
  
Meanwhile, enjoy the website.
