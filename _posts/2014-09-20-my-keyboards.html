<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've lived in France for 14 years. I loved the food. I loved the wine (and learned a lot about it). Even the people are nicer than you would expect. I also picked, partly, the accent. Not because I wanted it. It just happened.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, there is one thing I've always refused to adapt to, it's the AZERTY keyboard. It makes me insane. Mostly because<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The dot needs a shift key</li><li>The numbers need a shift key</li><li>The M is really far, you can't do it with your left hand while pressing the Windows key</li><li>It's impossible to put an accent on a capital letter ("Yes but we never put accents on a capital letter" "Yes but in Québec we do. So in Québec, "élodie".toUpperCase().toLowerCase() brings you back to&nbsp;"élodie". As expected"</li><li>And last but not least, parenthesis, brackets and square brackets are not opened and closed with the same hand</li></ul><div>Since I knew all this, I came to France with two Canadian French keyboards. The best keyboard to code is the English-US. But if you also want to write in French, Canadian French is the best compromise.</div><div><br /></div><div>One was used at home, one at work. I swapped them after 4 years because the work one was too used as you will see in the picture.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fY2VxprSWRM/VB3K6B6UW7I/AAAAAAAACtw/_WQQwYuMRQo/s1600/IMAG0139.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fY2VxprSWRM/VB3K6B6UW7I/AAAAAAAACtw/_WQQwYuMRQo/s1600/IMAG0139.jpg" height="181" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div>Both are now in the same state. After 7 years I bought two new ones. Sadly, the quality was not the same. The keys were too harsh to press. So I've replaced my work keyboard with a Logitech K800. At home, I'm typing on my laptop.</div><div><br /></div><div>I took the picture by nostalgia before coming back to Montreal and leaving the two well-used keyboards behind.</div><div><br /></div></div>
