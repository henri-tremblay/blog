I've lived in France for 14 years. I loved the food. I loved the wine (and learned a lot about it). Even the people are 
nicer than you would expect. I also picked, partly, the accent. Not because I wanted it. It just happened.

However, there is one thing I've always refused to adapt to, it's the AZERTY keyboard. It makes me insane. Mostly because

* The dot needs a shift key
* The numbers need a shift key
* The M is really far, you can't do it with your left hand while pressing the Windows key
* It's impossible to put an accent on a capital letter ("Yes but we never put accents on a capital letter" "Yes but in 
  Québec we do. So in Québec, `"élodie".toUpperCase().toLowerCase()` brings you back to `"élodie"`. As expected
* And last but not least, parenthesis, brackets and square brackets are not opened and closed with the same hand

Since I knew all this, I came to France with two Canadian French keyboards. The best keyboard to code is the English-US. 
But if you also want to write in French, the Canadian French layout is the best compromise.

One keyboard was used at home, one at work. I swapped them after 4 years because the work one was too used as you will see
in the picture.

Both are now in the same state. After 7 years I bought two new ones. Sadly, the quality was not the same. The keys were 
too harsh to press. So I've replaced my work keyboard with a Logitech K800. At home, I'm typing on my laptop.

I took the picture by nostalgia before coming back to Montreal and leaving the two well-used keyboards behind.
