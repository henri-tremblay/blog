<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">When creating this blog, the first thing I wanted to talk about are those things you learn everyday when fighting on a technical issue. Because if it happened to me, it will probably happen to you.<br /><br />What I discover is that a lot of these things are too small to be a blog post or will in fact just repeat a really nice existing blog post where I found my answer in the first place. And a blog post just telling you to read another blog post is not that useful.<br /><br />Instead, I've decided to tweet these blog posts each time I fell on one. I'll use the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">#WhatILearnedToday</span> hashtag. &nbsp;If you're interested, you can then <a href="https://twitter.com/henri_tremblay" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a>.<br /><br />See ya!</div>
