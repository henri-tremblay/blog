**UPDATE (2017-02-15):** Spring is correctly handling the `null` from `getMissingCache`. So you won't have to overload it. I was misled
by a framework that was incorrectly layering the `JCacheCacheManager`. I stand corrected and the article as well. Thanks to 
[St√©phane Nicoll](https://twitter.com/snicoll) for his vigilance.

**UPDATE (2017-02-16):** Spring has a `JCacheCacheConfiguration` that configure a JCache `CacheManager` using a list of cache names and a 
default cache configuration. By default, it uses `new MutableConfiguration<>()` so the article was updated accordingly.

**UPDATE (2017-04-07):** My [Hibernate PR](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/pull/1783) has been accepted. So you now have an elegant 
solution with the latest Hibernate versions. The article was updated accordingly.

***

I played a lot with JCache connectors lately. To plug [Ehcache 3](http://www.ehcache.org/) to different things. 

I noticed one really dangerous thing. Frameworks tend to spontaneously create caches that were not explicitly defined. I 
think it is coming from the JCache spirit that there should be a default cache configuration. It is nonetheless a bad idea. 

Let's look at two examples

# Spring

Caching in Spring is implemented by `spring-cache`. To plug JCache to `spring-cache` you use the `JCacheCacheManager`. By default 
when a cache isn't available in the `CacheManager`, Spring calls `JCacheCacheManager.getMissingCache`. So far so good.

The default implementation for this method returns `null` when a cache doesn't exist. This `null` will then be handled at 
higher levels to throw a nice exception.

If you want to explicitly support spontaneous cache creation, `getMissingCache` is where you should put your creation code. 

However, watch out if you do that. You might lost track of all the existing caches. And please, **never** do the following.

```java
@Override
protected Cache getMissingCache(String name) {
    Cache cache = super.getMissingCache(name);
    if(cache == null) {
        return new JCacheCache(cacheManager.createCache(name, new MutableConfiguration<>()));
    }
    return cache;
}
```
It returns a cache configured using default. It is never what you want.

Then, as usual, Spring tries to be nice with us. So if you enable caching (`@EnableCaching`), that the JSR-107 API is in  
the classpath and that you do not expose any `CacheManager`, Spring will create one for you.

The `JCacheCacheConfiguration` will get a default JSR-107 `CacheManager` and add a list of caches taken from the cache property 
`spring.cache.cache-names`. These caches are by default created using a `new MutableConfiguration<>()`. As we said above, this 
is not a correctly configured cache.

The solution is to expose the wanted cache configuration in a bean.

```java
@Bean
public javax.cache.configuration.Configuration<Object, Object> cacheConfiguration() {
    CacheConfiguration<Object, Object> cacheConfiguration = CacheConfigurationBuilder
        .newCacheConfigurationBuilder(Object.class, Object.class, ResourcePoolsBuilder
            .newResourcePoolsBuilder().heap(100))
        .build();
    javax.cache.configuration.Configuration<Object, Object> configuration =
        Eh107Configuration.fromEhcacheCacheConfiguration(cacheConfiguration);
    return configuration;
}
```

This bean will be magically used as cache default. You should always do this and never let ``new MutableConfiguration<>()` 
be used.
 
# Hibernate

To use JCache with Hibernate we need to use the `JCacheRegionFactory`. The problem with `JCacheRegionFactory` is that by 
default if a cache is not found, it will spontaneously create a cache by passing `new MutableConfiguration()`. This means 
that instead of using a properly configured cache, you end up with some random default configuration (infinite on heap for 
Ehcache).

This is really bad because it is pretty hard to detect.

What I recommend in this case is, again, to override the default. In the latest Hibernate versions (5.2.8+) (thanks to 
https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/pull/1783[HHH-1783], we can do the following

```java
@Override
protected Cache<Object, Object> createCache(String regionName, Properties properties, CacheDataDescription metadata) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown hibernate cache: " + regionName);
}
```

In older versions, sadly, there is no straightforward cache creation method to override. The best we have is 
`newDefaultConfig` which provides the default configuration. One sad thing is that you don't have the actual cache name 
here. You will need to debug to know it.

```java
@Override
protected Configuration<Object, Object> newDefaultConfig(Properties properties, CacheDataDescription metadata) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown hibernate cache: " + metadata);
}
```

Again, an alternative solution would be to provide a meaningful default cache configuration in this method.

# Conclusion

I do understand that frameworks do not like to fail with exceptions. This helps the feeling that they are working out of 
the box.

But I still think silently not caching or providing random default configuration is dangerous. Using my two workarounds should 
prevent you a lot of headaches.
