About a month ago, I was preparing my [OracleOne talk](https://oracle.rainfocus.com/widget/oracle/oow18/catalogcodeone18?search=%22henri%20tremblay%22) and 
tripped on a slide. I was trying to explain the new delivery process and how long the support of each version will last. 

It wasn't that clear at all.

So, I asked my felow [Java Champions](https://community.oracle.com/community/technology_network_community/java/java-champions)
about it. It triggered a discussion about the fact that it is indeed quite misunderstood.

We got together. Or to be honest, [Martijn](https://twitter.com/karianna) led the way and wrote an article to clarify the situation.
We then made multiple suggestions and corrections. Representatives of the main OpenJDK providers were also
involved. 
 
* Oracle (obviously)
* RedHat
* Azul
* IBM
* [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

So I now consider the [document](https://itnext.io/java-is-still-free-c02aef8c9e04) a must read for anyone interested in Java.

Is Java still free? Yes, it is. But don't let the train overrun you.
