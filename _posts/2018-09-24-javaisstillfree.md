About a month ago, I was preparing my [OracleOne talk](https://oracle.rainfocus.com/widget/oracle/oow18/catalogcodeone18?search=%22henri%20tremblay%22) and 
tripped on a slide. I was trying to explain the new delivery process and how long the support of each version will last. 

It wasn't that clear at all.

So, I asked my fellow [Java Champions](https://community.oracle.com/community/technology_network_community/java/java-champions)
about it. It triggered a discussion about the fact that it is indeed quite misunderstood.

We got together. Or to be honest, [Martijn](https://twitter.com/karianna) led the way and wrote an article to clarify the situation.
We then made multiple suggestions and corrections. Representatives of the main OpenJDK providers were also involved. 
 
* [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* Amazon
* Azul (actual supporter of )
* BellSoft
* IBM
* jClarity
* Oracle (obviously)
* RedHat (actual supporter of Java 8 and 11)
* SAP

So I now consider the [document](https://medium.com/@javachampions/java-is-still-free-2-0-0-6b9aa8d6d244) a must read for anyone interested in Java.

Is Java still free? Yes, it is.
