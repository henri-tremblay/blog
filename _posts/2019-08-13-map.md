Today’s topic is about `Map` and misuses I’ve seen during many code reviews.
 
The idea with a `Map` is to do whatever you need by doing as less hashing as possible.
A hash occurs each time you access the `Map` (e.g. `get`, `containsKey`, `put`).
 
In Java 8, some useful new methods were added.
Let’s say you want to check if something is in a `Map`:
* If it is, return it
* If it’s not, add it and return it
 
The classical way to do it is:

```java
if (map.containsKey(key)) { // one hash
    return map.get(key); // two hash
}
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
map.put(key, list); // three hash
return list;
```
 
It is also the slowest.
A better way is:

```java 
List<String> list = map.get(key); // one hash
if(list == null) {
    list = new ArrayList<>();
    map.put(key, list); // two hash
}
return list;
```

This is already much better. You save one hash.
 
**Important:** This isn’t valid if the value might be `null`. 
But I highly recommend you to never have null values
 
But since Java 8, you have three better solutions.
 
The first one is:

```java
map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>()); // one hash
return map.get(key); // two hash
```
 
It is better but not much. You still have two hashes. 
And the `ArrayList` is instantiated even if it is already in the map.

You can improve with the longer:

```java 
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> result = map.putIfAbsent(key, list); // one hash only!
if(result == null) {
    return list;
}
return result;
```
 
Now we’re talking, only one hash! But still the `ArrayList` is instantiated uselessly.
 
Which brings us to another Java 8 method that does the trick.
 
```java
return map.computeIfAbsent(key, unused -> new ArrayList<>()); // one hash only!
```

Job done. 
One line and the fastest we can get. 
The `ArrayList` will be instantiated only when needed.
 
**Important:** Do not do `map.computeIfAbsent(key, ArrayList::new)`. 
`computeIfAbsent` takes a `Function<KEY, VALUE>` in parameter. 
So this will in general not compile unless the `KEY` matches the parameter of one of the ArrayList constructors. 
An example is when the `KEY` is an Integer. 
Passing a constructor method reference will actually call `new ArrayList(KEY)`… which is obviously not what you want.

In order to convince you that it's the best solution, I have made a little benchmark using JMH. 
Here are the results:

Til next time: Happy mapping.
