Hello everyone,

This week I have a refactoring challenge to propose.
It's something I did last year but that I should have advertised more.

I’ve coded a little service (`ReportingService`) that needs some love.

The idea is to make it easily testable and readable. 
Just open a pull request with your code to show me your ideas.

The code is on [Github](https://github.com/henri-tremblay/refactoring).

See where you can go!

My solution is in the ‘henri’ branch but please don’t look at it before trying it out.

Please refrain yourself from just show casing new Java features.
That's not what will improve readability, testability and so on.

All interesting ideas will be mentioned in a follow up post.

Have fun!
