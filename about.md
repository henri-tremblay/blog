This blog is written by Henri Tremblay. 

I'm Java Champion, IT architect and strategist, [EasyMock](http://easymock.org) and [Objenesis](http://objenesis.org) lead developer,
trainer and speaker.

I'm also a father of two joyful little things, a husband and an epicurean.

I try to learn something everyday.

I try to be useful.
